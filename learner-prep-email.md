Thanks for registering for the upcoming Ladies Learning Code workshop! There is no need to print a ticket or confirmation - we'll check you in electronically the day of the workshop.

We want to be able to dive right in and start learning at the workshop so there are a few things you need to prepare in advance below. Reminder, this workshop is BYOL so be sure to bring a laptop, power cord and computer mouse (if you're more comfortable using one than a trackpad).

HOW TO PREPARE:

[Install Ruby]

Mac Users:
Ruby is already on your computer. It comes with it! You just need to make sure you can open the application "Terminal". Go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal or search for it using Spotlight

Windows Users:

(if you are on your work computer, you may have to ask IT at work if you don't have administrator privileges)
1. Go to http://rubyinstaller.org
2. Click the "Download" button
3. Click 'Ruby 2.4.2-2 (x86)' (or the most recent version) under RubyInstallers and save the file to your desktop
4. Once the file has finished downloading, double-click on rubyinstaller-2.4.1-2-x86.exe
5. Once setup is running, click 'I accept the License'
6. Click 'Next'
7. Do not change the default install directory, C:\Ruby202
8. Tick 'Add Ruby executables to your PATH'
9. Tick 'Associate .rb and .rbw files with this Ruby installation'
10. DO NOT tick "Install Tcl/Tk support"
11. Click 'Install'
12. Click 'Finish' when you see the completion window
13. Another window will appear asking to install MSYS2. Enter 1 when asked for [1,2,3] and hit enter. Once done, uncheck the 'Run MSYS2' box

If you run into trouble with these instructions, don't worry! Just arrive a few minutes early on Thursday after 5:30pm and one of our amazing developer volunteers will help you out.
